# Coin Cursed - Unity 2D Endless Runner

Coin Cursed is a fast-paced 2D endless runner where collecting coins increases your speed â€” but speed can be both your power and your downfall. Players must strategically drop coins to navigate speed-gated paths, overcome obstacles, and survive a procedurally generated world.

## Features
- Coin-based speed scaling system
- Manual coin drop mechanic for skillful speed control
- Speed-gated barriers that dynamically change your route
- Slide, jump, and directional movement system
- World-space gate indicators with TextMeshPro
- UI for live coin count and speed tracking
- Cinemachine-based smooth camera follow

## Technologies
- Unity 6
- C# scripting
- TextMeshPro
- Cinemachine
- Custom 2D chunk system (in progress)

## What I Learned
- Modular procedural level generation
- Dynamic UI updates with gameplay variables
- Real-time player speed manipulation
- Clean object hierarchies for interactive environments
- Best practices for reusable chunk-based world design
